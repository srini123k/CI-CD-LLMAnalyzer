1. Define the Problem Scope
Detecting failed jobs in recent pipelines.

Fetching job logs using GitLab API.

Sending them to an LLM for analysis.

Returning a natural language summary + fix suggestion.

2. High-Level Architecture

+----------------------+
|   GitLab CI/CD       |
|  (pipeline & logs)   |
+----------+-----------+
           |
           | 1️⃣ Fetch job logs via GitLab API
           v
+----------------------+
|   Python Backend     |
| (FastAPI or Streamlit)|
+----------+-----------+
           |
           | 2️⃣ Send logs to LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4 or local LLM)
           v
+----------------------+
|     LLM Engine       |
|  (Analyze, summarize)|
+----------+-----------+
           |
           | 3️⃣ Return insights & suggestions
           v
+----------------------+
|   Dashboard / CLI    |

4 Send notifications in slack

3. Sample Workflow

-- Fetch logs from Gitlab by using Gitlab API token
-- Send logs to LLM
-- Display output
-- Send notification message in Slack channel


4. Business Value

Faster RCA: Reduces MTTR from hours to minutes.

Knowledge transfer: Converts raw logs into human-readable explanations.

Scalability: Works across teams, not just senior engineers.

Cost savings: Fewer manual investigations, faster release cycles.
